    <ul>
        <li>First a table is created having two columns one memory allocation and other as code execution.</li>
        <li>The Js file executes line by line from top to bottom  by storing variables as undefined at first.</li>
        <li>In Memory Allocation table x is stored as undefined, skips the function definition untill its called.</li>
        <li>Then at last it comes to function named girl and make another table inside code execution having two columns one memory allocation and other as code execution.</li>
        <li>Now in code execution we get x value as 21. so, in memory allocation x value is replaced to 21 in place of undefined.</li>
        <li>Now again it comes at function girl and see console.log statement to print x , as X is called before declaring the variable with in the function . x returns as undefined(because of hoisting).</li>

        <li>First a table is created having two columns one memory allocation and other as code execution.</li>
        <li>the Js file executes line by line from top to bottom by storing variables as undefined at first.</li>
        <li>in Memory Allocation table x is stored as undefined, function definition is called so it makes another table side code execution having two columns one memory allocation and other as code execution.</li>
        <li> now in code execution we get x value as 21. so, in memory allocation x value is replaced to 21 in place of undefined.</li>
        <li>now again it comes at function girl and see console.log statement to print x , as X is called before declaring the variable with in the function . x returns as undefined(because of hoisting).</li>
        <li>As first girl function has been called it returns undefined from local scope and then goes back to global scope where x value is replaced as 21 from undefined.</li></ul>

        <ul>
            <li>In global scope x value is undefined at first.</li>
            <li>Then function "a" is called following it function "b" is called , they both create execution context table to store x values.</li>
            <li>In global scope x value is replace by 21 from undefined.</li>
            <li>Next line is function a , in it as x value is not declared. x value get redeclared and becomes 20 . Giving o/p as 20</li>
            <li>Next line is function b, in it as x value is not declared. x value get redeclared and becomes 40 . Giving o/p as 40</li>

    <h1>Q7. Write a function that accepts parameter n and returns factorial of n</h1>

    function DisplayData(data, batch){
        console.log(`i am from ${data} and My batch is EA${batch}`)
    }
    
    DisplayData("PrepBytes", FindSum(10, 9));</pre>
    <p>o/p => i am from Prepbytes and My batch is EA19</p>
    <p>This is a call back function, function 2 is dependent on function 1</p>
    <hr>

    <h1>Q9. Guess the output</h1>
    <pre>
        Abc();
     const Abc = function(){
    let value = 20;
    console.log(value);
    }
    </pre>
    <p>o/p => reference error.</p>
    <p>It will give refernce error because the code is of function expression or first class expression ( Declared a function and assigned in a variable) and have use let which is function scope. Calling a function before defininig with let and const gives output as reference error</p>

    <h1>Q10. Guess the output</h1>
    <pre>
        var a = 10;
        (function (){
         console.log(a);
        var a = 20;
      })();

    </pre>
    <p>o/p => undefined</p>

    <p>Here the code is Immediately Invoked Function expression which gives the output as soon as function is written. Here a have been consoled before defininig

    <h1>Q11. Guess the Output</h1>
    <pre>const greet =  function(name){
        return function(m){
        
            console.log(`Hi!! ${name}, ${m}`);
        }
    }
    const greet_message = greet('EA19');
    greet_message("Welcome To PrepBytes")
      </pre>
    <p>o/p => Hi!! EA19 Welcome To PrepBytes</p>

    <p>There is a function within a function, first function greet has value as 'EA19' so name is assigned as 'EA19' and then within it there is another function m which will take value as "Welcome To PrepBytes" on calling second function. 
        Using String literal the output is concatenated to provide the above output
